# Cooking-timer
Multi-Cooking Timer Application
Python
Tkinter

Timer for tracking cooking time on a 4-burner stove. This application allows you to mark the right time for cooking at the same time as working on the computer, in one window for all 4 burners.

A Python GUI application featuring four independent countdown timers in a 2x2 grid layout, built with Tkinter.

Features

🍉 Four independent timers - Each timer runs completely separately
🍍 Quick start presets - 5, 15, and 35 minute quick-start buttons
🍒 Manual time entry - Set custom times in HH:MM:SS format
🫐 Visual alerts - Flashing notification when timer completes
🥥 Modern UI - Clean, color-coded interface with flat design
🍇 Responsive layout - Adapts to window resizing

# How It Works
The application creates a 2×2 grid of timer panels, each containing:

 Timer label showing the timer number
 Quick-start buttons for common durations
 Time entry field for custom durations
 Control buttons (Start/Reset)
 Alert display that appears when timer completes
 Each timer maintains its own state including:

Current time remaining
Running status
Alert flash counter
